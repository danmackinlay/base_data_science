# Generic data science repository

I start from this repository if I want to build something academic.

## Setup

Automate
[jupyter notebook stripping](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/develop.html#after-git-clone-1-a-mandatory-notebook-strip-out)
by running, from repo root,

```bash
tools/run-after-git-clone
```

This will strip notebook everywhere except under outputs/.
